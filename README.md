## Background

Pain is a multi-dimensional experience involving emotional, sensory and motivational aspects. Hypnosis is one intersting psychological 
 tool among many others (like placebo or meditation) that have been shown to effectively modulate pain. Verbal suggestions are an important component of hypnosis and are defined as verbal instructions that are intended to change or induce a cognition, behavior or sensory experience. In the case of pain, suggestions can be hyperalgesic or hypoalgesic, and are intended to increase or decrease pain, respectively. Verbal suggestions to reduce pain can reduce or amplify the brain activity evoked during painful experiences (e.g. during the administration of electrical shocks). 

Studies show that the experience of pain is not correlated with spatially restricted brain activity, but rather is the result of activity in several regions (e.g. anterior mid-Cingulate Cortex, insula, thalamus, somatosensory cortex). Given the distributed nature of brain activity during the experience of pain, multivariate pattern analyses seem to be a good approach to study the subjective experience of pain.

In order to better understand how verbal instructions (such as hyper/hypoalgesia) are integrated by the brain and then result in a modulation of brain activity during the administration of painful stimuli, this project aims to decode pain-related brain activity and identify activation patterns that predict a specific type of verbal suggestion. 


## Tools


A machine learning approach will be used to decode pain-evoked brain activity and predict verbal suggestions that was administered prior to painful stimulation.

The tools used to accomplish this task are:

⋅⋅ Python scripts
⋅⋅ Python modules (pandas, numpy, sklearn, nilearn, nibabel,  matplotlib, seaborn)
⋅⋅ Bash to run the scripts on elm server
⋅⋅ Git and Github to keep track of the project's evolution

# Data

The dataset that will be used comes from Desmartaux et al., 2021 and is access restricted. It includes 24 participants (13 women and 11 males) and mean age is 26.9. Subjects participated to a fMRI scanning session where they received hypnosis to either increase or decrease pain. After hypnotic suggestions to modulate pain,a serie of either 6 or 9 painful stimuli were administered. In total, each participant received 72 electrical shocks. Across all participants, a total of 1728 trials/shocks were done.
